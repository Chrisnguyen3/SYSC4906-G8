Our project will look to analyze the effects that the 2021 British Columbia wildfires had on the prices of specific items related to wildfires and/or natural disasters. Once concluding a multi year data scrape of Keepa for the listed products we will look to see if there is any noticeable increase in price on specific items or any items at all. From this we will recommend whether or not some of our listed items should be purchased well in advance to any natural disaster, close to or around natural disasters or could be purchased during natural disasters.
