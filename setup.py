Once concluding a multi year data scrape of Keepa for the listed products we will look to see if there is any noticeable increase in price on specific items or any items at all. From this we will recommend whether or not some of our listed items should be purchased well in advance to any natural disaster, close to or around natural disasters or could be purchased during natural disasters.',
